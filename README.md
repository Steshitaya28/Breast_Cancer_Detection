# Breast_Cancer_Detection
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer and is causing a huge number of deaths in women. In this project, I developed Machine Learning Classification Models to detect breast cancer based on a set of features calculated from a digitized image of the Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) of a breast mass from a patient.
